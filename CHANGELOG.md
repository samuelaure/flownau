All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- **Phase 8: Polish & Monitoring (Premium UX Enhancement)**
  - Advanced Loading States:
    - Implemented high-performance Skeleton UI for `AssetBrowser` using CSS transforms and shimmer animations.
    - Integrated CSS Font Loading API with explicit indicators to eliminate FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text).
    - Specialized asset and folder card skeletons for responsive grid and list views.
  - User Onboarding System:
    - Interactive 7-step "First Visit" guide with dynamic element highlighting using a consolidated pierced backdrop strategy.
    - Modern welcome modal with priority feature highlights and persistence using Zustand + LocalStorage.
    - Spotlight effect for guided tours that respects stacking contexts (remediated with radial-gradient overlay).
  - Performance Monitoring (Dev Tools):
    - Real-time FPS counter with 60-frame rolling average and color-coded status.
    - Component-specific render time tracking using High-Resolution Time and Performance API marks/measures.
    - Expandable diagnostics panel with performance warnings for low-frame-rate scenarios.
    - Multi-subscriber support for monitoring utilities to ensure system-wide resilience.

### Fixed

- Remediated Tutorial Spotlight positioning where coordinates were static.
- Fixed `FPSMonitor` singleton vulnerability by implementing an observer pattern for multiple hooks.
- Improved z-index resilience of highlighted elements using a radial-gradient "piercing" overlay.

### Technical Wins

- **Architectural Integrity**: Decoupled performance monitoring logic from UI components using clean observable patterns.
- **Resilience**: Established bulletproof component-level highlighting that survives complex nested stacking contexts.
- **Performance**: Zero production overhead for dev-only monitoring tools; GPU-accelerated skeletal animations.
