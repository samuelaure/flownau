# Flownaŭ

**An end-to-end automated video publishing platform.**

Flownaŭ is a unified media factory that orchestrates the entire lifecycle of short-form video content. It combines template-based programmatic rendering (Remotion) with a robust asset management pipeline (R2/FFmpeg) and automated social publishing (Instagram Graph API).

- **Programmatic Video**: Render dynamic videos based on flexible templates using Remotion.
- **Automated Publishing**: Schedule and auto-publish content to multiple Instagram accounts.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Manage multiple workspaces, projects, and social profiles in a single dashboard.

## Tech Stack

## Origins

Flownaŭ is the evolution and unification of two previous projects:

- [Astromatic](https://github.com/samuelaure/astromatic): The original Remotion-based rendering engine.
